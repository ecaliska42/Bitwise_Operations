/*
    NOT is a unary operator. (means it requires just one operand)
    Its job is to complement each bit one by one.
    Result of NOT is 0 when bit is 1 and
                     1 when bit is 0
*/
/*
example:

   No.|  Op.| No. in bits
    7 --> ~  0 | 1 | 1 | 1
    ----------------------
    8 <--    1 | 0 | 0 | 0 //RESULT OF NOT OPERATOR (0 = 1 and 1 = 0)

    ~ 7 = 8
